After falling in love with analog circuits making my guitar effects pedals, I was very eager to build my own guitar amp. I thought long and hard about which amp I would like to create and ended up thinking whatever it was... it would be based on an old Fender.

This was before I stumbled across [TubeDepot](https://www.tubedepot.com). After digging through their parts I noticed that they had [Tube Amp Kits](https://www.tubedepot.com/t/diy-central/kits-tube-amp/guitar-tube-amp-kits)! i imediately started doing some maths to work out if they were a good deal.. and my god... the prices are amazing!

After a bit of research I decided I wanted to build a Fender 5e3 Tweed Deluxe. The 5e3 is a lovely sounding and electronically simple, class a, tewb driven guitar amplifier. (More info can be found at [Wikipedia - Fender Deluxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Deluxe_Amp#Tweed_Deluxe)).

The kit arrived rather fast, it took about a fortnight to get to me. Considering the size of the boxes and the fact I'm on the other side of the world to continental America... 2 weeks is a pretty darn good shipping time. Everything was packed great, i was curious as to how to tewbs would handle their flight, but they arrived in one piece, along with the components, speaker, cabinet and chassis. I did have to request another Capacitor as only two high voltage caps turned up in the kit rather than three, i believe this is because the packer got confused as to whether this was a 5e3 or a 5f1. I was sent a new cap immediately and was very happy with the customer service. Seriously I cant recommend Tube Depot enough.

I immediately started reading the instructions (this is a pretty rare occasion... I'm one of those dickheads that will put everything together and then check the manual later to find out I got it half right and almost blew something up). I didn't want to take any risks considering I hadn't dealt with voltages above 240VAC before. These amps go much higher than that.

I was very please to find that Rob Hull has a tutorial [video of the build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgA4JG7978c). Go check it out, he steps though it piece by piece and it helped me understand how i should start this project, and what it would entail. I quickly realised it was going to take me more than a single afternoon. It ended up taking me about 20 Hours to complete, but a lot of that time was double checking as this was my first time dealing with higher than wall socket voltages, I really didn't want my ample to explode when I switched it on.

I got a bit impatient towards then end of the build as I had some mates coming over that afternoon for a jam and i really wanted to get the amp done before they arrived. In the end I managed to finish it off, but the wiring could have been a little neater.

That being said... there is absolutely no nasty hum or buzz and the amp sounds spectacular. I really do wonder how much of what I read about the wiring in these amps is true, it sounds perfect as is when compared to real "Shop Bought" tube amplifiers. The best part is I didn't have to sacrifice a virgin goat to the tone gods, or even stick my tongue out the left side of my mouth as I put it together. It just worked first time and sounded great!

The top of the amplifier, notice I fucked up the first screw holes...

The guts! and my shitty wiring ;)

Another shot of the inside with a bit more speaker in it. (The Jensen sounds absolutely amazing, when I tested my shitty Behringer with it the amp almost sounded nice!):

Obligatory shot of tube glowing... (it was the day time so it was pretty hard to capture then tewby goodness):
