You know how it goes, you watch some BA then next second you're in the kitchen doing your own rendition of whatever the craze of the week is. With no recollection of how or when you got there. The only thing you know is whatever ungodly creation that sits before you,it's gonna be tasty and most likely highly experimental.

This is exactly how I felt on this day. I was standing in my kitchen looking down at a tray of donuts. I had never made donuts, cake or yeasted, and didn't even know that sourdough donuts existed until 4 hours prior. I had even roped my partner into the production line, she was rolling them in sugar and cinnamon while I was frying them.

2019, what a time to be alive (with Brad).
