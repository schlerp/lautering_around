Risotto was long a dish I thought too difficult to make. However, this assumption turned out to be wrong! Risotto is very simple and with a few small tips, you'll be making your own in no time! To me, the defining characteristics for risotto are creamy richness, toothsome rice, and a hint of white wine in the background.

I start my risotto by making a mushroom stock. Into a large pot of boiling water goes two quartered onions, some bay leaves, dried shitake mushrooms, dried porcini mushrooms, and if you feel inclined some dried chillis. I let this boil for an hour or so before I strain. I often keep some of the dried mushrooms for addition to the risotto, but if you have enough fresh mushrooms you can dispose of all the strained solids.

Once the stock is made it's time to get cracking with the risotto. Start the risotto by finely dicing some shallots and garlic. Fry these up in a large pan (I personally make my risotto's in a wok) using half butter and half olive oil as the frying fat. I also add a touch of salt and pepper to the onions and garlic as they cook. Once the onion has turned translucent it is time to add the mushrooms, I find shitake or swiss browns to be my favourite, but oyster, enoki or even field mushrooms will work fine in this dish. once the mushrooms have softened add the arborio rice and fry for a minute or two until the rice is coated with the butter and oil mixture. At this point we deglaze the pan with a dry white wine. Once the alcohol has cooked off it is time to add the thyme. Begin adding the mushroom stock to the pan about half a cup at a time (or a ladle full or so if you are using a ladle). continuously stir this mixture until your spoon will leave a trail that you can see the bottom of the pan, at this point it is time for the next ladle. Continue this process until the rice is cooked. I often stir through a small knob of butter, or some sharp Italian cheese (romano, pecorino or parmesan) right as I'm finishing up my risotto. Risotto should be served slightly al dente, this means that the rice should not be soft like warm butter or poridge, but should hold its shape and have a slight mouthfeel when consumed.

Contrary to popular belief risotto is served on a plate rather than in a bowl. This is so you can flatten out the risotto and eat it as the edge of the plate cool. I grate some parmesan cheese over my risotto. This dish is simple and serves as a base for many other risotto variations you can cook. If you don't have time to make the stock yourself, store-bought chicken stock or vegetarian stock can be substituted. On occasion I add some chicken tenders to the risotto, I marinate them in garlic, white wine and thyme in the fridge for a few hours before I cook them, the place them to the side to stir in near to end to ensure they aren't over cooked.
