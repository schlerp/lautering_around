For a while I have been maing foccacia. It's been a bit of a labour of love, anytime we are invited to dinner or a party I offer to make one. I'm slowly starting to perfect my recipe and it basically comes down to a 75% hydration dough with a shit ton of olive oil. The final rest is done in a heavily oiled pan, and I use my fingers to push down all over the surface to leave those characteristic poc marks across the top of the focaccia.

Once the marks have been made I pour some more oil over the top and sprinkle toppings of my choice. I have found thyme and sea salt to be quite effective and simple, with the occasional addition of a light sprinkle of grated parmesian cheese to go down a treat amoungst my friends.
