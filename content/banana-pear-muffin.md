As I sat enjoying some episodes of Gotham on a lazy Sunday afternoon, I recalled I had some very ripe bananas in the fridge.

This isn't the first time I've used Sally's Baking Addiction - "The best banana cake I've ever had" recipe however it seems every time I do the end result quite literally is the best banana cake I've ever had! This time I only had two bananas where her recipe calls for three, so I finely grated a pear to mix things up!

As you've seen in Patty's other food posts we basically have the pantry set to bake anything, so I didn't even need leave the house to make the bad boys. Add in a quick google of how to make your own buttermilk, as that isn't a staple item in our home! (FYI there's a couple options, but I use the old milk and vinegar trick).

After mixing the butter and sugars together Sally gets you to add the eggs and vanilla. Not to worry, the batter has not gone bad with these additions however it does look quite curdled!

Continue on with the recipe and add the buttermilk and dry ingredients to find the batter turn into a smooth, delicious smelling mixture... the hints of cinnamon are delightful!

Quite literally finger-licking/ hand mixer good! Sally has you place the batter into a cake tin however I like to make muffins with this recipe. They cook and are ready for consumption faster, as well as being easy to freeze for snacks. PSA: you probably won't have any to freeze as they are delish!

Put the muffin tray in a pre-heated oven 170&deg;C for approximately 25 minutes and wahlah! Lovely golden looking muffins ready to eat, mind your fingers, might be best to rest for ten minutes first!

And that's a wrap! The muffins didn't rise like I expected, so am not sure if I can attribute that to the added pear, mixing the batter a bit too much or perhaps the flour. Sally has you making a cream cheese frosting, which is also to die for however I stuck with the muffins. Nonetheless, they were delicious! Thanks for letting me hijack your blog Patty!
