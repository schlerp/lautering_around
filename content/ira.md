I made an Indian Red Ale. It started as an IPA but I didnt hit the gravity I wanted. I made the trip to my local homebrew supply store, however they didnt have any malt or sugar for sale! The next nearest on is one town over so I made the trip (only about half an hour) but they were sold out of everything except liquid dark wheat malt extract. I added this assuming the brew would turn brown, and be in the style of an Indian Brown Ale. Turns out part of this assumption was right, it definitely tasted like an Indian Brown Ale, but it turned bright red! If only I could get this colour when im trying to brew a red! I think next time I tackle a red ale I will look into using toasted wheat malts.
