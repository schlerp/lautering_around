Summary: We brewed a Session IPA with NZ hops and Kviek yeast!

#### The beer

Last weekend a mate and I double batched a Session IPA. I had some Kviek yeast and i wanted to compare it side by side with the same beer brewed using US-05. It's intended to come in at around 4.3% ABV. The grist came in at a total weight of 4.75 kg. Ale malt was used as a base since its what we had on hand. The Vienna, Wheat and Caramalt were all added to try and build body on this beer since it was coming in at relatively low ABV for an IPA and needed some character to support the mount of hops we inteded to use. I had a lot of NZ hop flowers in my freezer I intended to get rid of so I brought them around to my mates place for brew day. We used Motueka and Nelson Sauvin in equal parts for our bittering and flavouring hops.

#### The malt 

  * 3 kg (63.2%) — Gladfield Ale Malt — Grain — 6 EBC
  * 1 kg (21.1%) — Barrett Burston Vienna Malt — Grain — 6.9 EBC
  * 500 g (10.5%) — Barrett Burston Wheat Malt — Grain — 3 EBC
  * 250 g (5.3%) — Bairds Caramalt Malt — Grain — 29.5 EBC

#### The mash 

We mashed in at around 2pm, a little later than intended since I hadn't stored my robobrew very well from the last brew day, it needed a quick hose out. After milling the grain we both mashed in at 74&deg;C and started our mash timer. Our actual mash tempreture was 71&deg;C and we both hit this perfectly once the grain was added. After an hour of solid mashing, with a few stirs in between I decided we should mash for another 20 minutes. I decided this for two reasons, I was balls deep in a game of MTG and my run off looked a little turbid still (probably from the last stir, but an extended mash wasnt going to hurt this beer). 

#### The boil

After a solid 90 minutes of mashing we pulled our grain tubes out and sparged with as hot water as we could get from the tap. We played some more MTG as we waited for our robo brews to come up to boil. Mine hit temp first and almost boilded over, although in typical fashion, as soon as I noticed it was about to boil over and grabbed the spray bottle, it settled down. Hops were added as per the hopping schedule below, and we continued to play MTG in amoungst preparing a ginger beer (thats right this was a tripple brew day! seperate post to come about that).
