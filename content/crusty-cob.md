Crusty Cob is one of my favourite types of bread. A giant boule of crusty white bread is so versatile and fits almost any occasion! I make my cob's at approximately 65-70% hydration. I often just decide roughly how big I want it then pick an easy number to split into thirds. If I use 600g of flour, then its easy to just add 400ml of tepid water to get a 66% hydrated dough. AS fiddly as bread can be aiming for around 66% gives you a bit of leeway for differing flours and how much water they need to hydrate. If the flour absorbs more water than usual, you will still have a loose enough dough, just like if they flour doesn't hydrate as much you will still have around 70% hydration.

To my 600g of strong bread flour I add 400ml (400g) of tepid water, a teaspoon or two of caster sugar, a teaspoon and a half of salt, and the same again of instant dried baking yeast. If I have time I make a Biga with the flour and most of the water, while I do a yeast starter with a small amount of flour, the sugar, the remainder of the water and the yeast. If doing it using this method I will not add salt until it is time to combine everything and knead the dough. Doing this slower longer method gets a nicer flavour in the bread, but throwing it all together at once still makes a superb loaf.

Once all ingredients are combined I knead the dough for 5 or so minutes then place back into a lightly oiled bowl to let rest in a warm place (I live in Darwin, Australia, so that's literally anywhere inside or outside my house). Once the dough has doubled in size (usually about 45 mins to an hour) I take the dough from the bowl and do a second knead. If the dough is still too loose at this point to knead I will instead opt for the lifting and folding technique, this can be found online but basically consists of picking the dough up from the middle and folding over itself. This is an alternate method of kneading and is often much easier to use when your dough is of high hydration. I then repeat the previous process again, letting the dough double in size before I do another knead. If I am using the folding method for a higher hydration dough I instead lift and fold every half an hour or so for a total of about 4-5 times until I get a nicely fermented dough that gives me a good gluten window when stretched.

At this point it is time to shape into a boule and proof for approximately 20 minutes. I often shape my boule and place onto some baking paper on top of a pizza peel while my oven is heating up to 240&deg;C. I have a pizza stone in my oven which I think is an important part of making good bread. Once the dough has proved I place into the oven on my pizza stone and add a cup of water into a baking tray on the bottom of my oven. I give the dough 10-15 mins in the steamy oven at 240&deg;C before I open the door and let most of the steam out, swap the oven to fan forced and turn it down to 200&deg;C for another 20 minutes or so until the bread has finished baking.
