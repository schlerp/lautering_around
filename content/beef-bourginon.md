Beef Bourguignon is a red wine stew from central France. It consists of mirepoix (onion, celery, and carrot), beef, lardons, and bouquet garni slow cooked in red wine. My favourite way to cook this is hung over as fuck on a Sunday.

Slice up the **Onion**, **Carrot** and **Celery**. **Carrot** takes a little longer than the **Onion** and **Celery** to cook, you should therefore cut it thinner!

> If your not hung over and starving, try to somewhere in the range of **Brunoise - Macédoine (3-6mm cubes)**

Place **Butter**, **Lardons** and a bit of **Olive Oil** into a Chassuer, add in the **Rosemary**, **Oregano**, and **Bay Leaves**.

> I had some **Sage** that looked too good to not add growing in my garden, if you add **Sage**, be careful, it has a strong flavour that is easy to overuse.

Once the Herbs are fragrant, add in the **Mirepoix** vegetables, **Garlic** and a touch more **Butter** if it looks a bit dry.

Sauté the vegetables until they start to soften and appear translucent. at this point transfer everything to a bowl and place to the side.

Add some more **Butter**, **Olive Oil**, **Garlic** and **Lardons** to the Chassuer (if you want, you can dig out some of those herbs from the Vegetable bowl to add into the butter again). Add **Cubed Beef** and saute until brown.

> I like these chunks to be fairly hearty, I'm talking maybe inch or so cubes.

Once the meat is browned, return the **Mirepoix** and **herb** mix from before to the pan. Add half a bottle or so of **Red Wine**, and a cup or two of **Beef/Vegetable Stock**, the idea is to ensure that everything is covered. Wait until the pot reaches a slow simmer. We want to cook off the alcohol in the **Red Wine**, continue simmering until the smell changes from sour to sweet (usually up to ten minutes from the point you add the **Red Wine**).

> Bonus points here if you make your own stock!

Add in some **Diced Potato**. I usually aim for about **Macédoine (*6mm*)** cubes.

Put the lid on and place the Chassuer in an oven at around **160&deg;C**, cook for approximately 60-90 Minutes. You will know when it is ready because the beef will be tender and the vegetables will be soft.

> If you like **Mushrooms** add some in about 20-30 minutes after you put it into the oven, you want to add these after the other vegetables, 

ps. I love garlic bread! Generally I would serve this with a nice **Crusty Bread**, toasted with **Garlic Butter**.
